**1. For the given data set
    1. Find the mean,mode and median.
    2. Show the boxplot of the data clearly indicating five numbers sumary of data.**

Data : 11, 13, 13,  15, 15, 16, 19, 20, 20, 20, 21, 21, 22, 23, 24, 30, 40, 45, 45, 45, 71, 72, 73, 75**


**2. Explain different data visualization techniques that can be used in Data Mining**

The different visualization techniques include

Geometric techniques: scatterplots matrices, Hyperslice,parallel coordinates
Pixel-oriented techniques: simple line-by-line, spiral and circle segments
Hierarchical techniques: Treemap, cone trees
Graph-based techniques: 2D and 3D graph
User interaction: brushing, linking, dynamic projections and rotations, dynamic queries

1.Geometric techniques

Basic idea:
• Visualization of geometric transformations andprojections of the data

Methods:
• Scatterplot matrices: A scatterplot matrix is composed of scatter plots of all possible pairs of
variables in a dataset.Assuming a N-dimension dataset, there are (N2-N)/2 pairs of two dimension plots
• Hyperslice :HyperSlice is an extension of the scatterplot matrix. They represent a
multi-dimensional function as a matrix of orthogonal two-dimensional slices
• Parallel coordinates: • The axes are defined as parallel vertical lines separated A point in Cartesian coordinates
correspond to a polyline in parallel coordinates Able to visualize data that may be occluded in Cartesian coordinates

2.Pixel-oriented techniques

Basic idea:
• The basic idea of pixel-oriented techniques is to map eachdata value to a colored pixel
• Each attribute value is represented by a pixel with a colortone proportional to a relevance factor in a separate
window
Methods:
• Simple Arrangement Line-by-Line
• Spiral and Circle Segments Techniques

3.Hierarchical techniques

Basic idea:
• Visualization of the data using a hierarchical partitioning into two- or three-dimensional
subspaces
Methods:
• Treemap:Divide a limited screen space display area into a sequence of rectangles whose areas correspond to an attribute of data set
• Cone trees:3-dimensional extension of the more familiar 2-D hierarchical tree structures, to a more intuitive navigation and display of information

4.Graph Tree: Graphs (edges + nodes) with labels and attributes
• Used where emphasis is on data relationship
(databases, telecom)
• Coordinates not always meaningful
• Useful for discovering patterns

Methods:
• 3D graphs: It has more room for objects and different points of view
 Example (hypertexts – Narcissus) 

5.User interaction
Methods:
• Brushing: selecting points or regions
• Linking: more views work together
• Dynamic projections and rotations :Interactively and continuously moving through subspaces
• Dynamic queries
– Visual interface (button and sliders)
– Incremental behavior (undo)

**3. What is text mining ? Explain different approaches to the text mining ?**

Text Mining is the procedure of synthesizing information, by analyzing relations, patterns, and rules among textual data-semi structured or unstructured text.
This procedure contains text summarization, text categorization and text clustering.
Text summarization is the procedure to extract its partial content reflection to its whole contents automatically.
Text categorization is the procedure of assigning a category to the text among categories predefined by users.
Text clustering is the procedure of segmenting texts into several clusters, depending on the substantial relevance.
Techniques:

Data mining
Machine learning
Information retrieval
Statistics
Natural –language understanding
Case-based reasoning
Text Mining Approaches:

Keyword based Association Analysis:

Collect sets of keywords or terms that occur frequently together and then find the association or correlation relationship among them.
First preprocess the text data by parsing, stemming, removing stop words, etc.
Then evoke association mining algorithms -Consider each document as a transaction -View a set of keywords in the document as set of items in the transaction.
Term level association mining
No need for human effort in tagging documents. -The number of meaningless results and the execution time is greatly reduced.
Document Classification Analysis:

Automatic document classification:

Automatic classification for the tremendous number of on-line text documents(Web pages, emails, etc)
Text document classification differs from the classification of relational data as document databases are not structured according to attribute-value pairs.
Association-Based Document Classification:

Extract keywords and terms by information retrieval and simple association analysis techniques.
Obtain concept hierarchies of keywords and terms using Available term classes such as WordNet, Expert knowledge.
Classify documents in the training set into class hierarchies.
Apply term association mining method to discover sets of associated terms.
Use the term to maximally distinguish one class of documents from others.
Derive a set of association rules associated with each document class.
Order the classification rule based on their occurrence frequency and discriminative power.
Used the rules to classify new documents.
3. Document Clustering Analysis:

Automatically group related documents based on their contents.
Require no training sets or predetermined taxonomies, generate a taxonomy at runtime,
Major steps:
Preprocessing: Remove stop words, stem, feature extraction.
Hierarchical clustering: Compute similarities applying clustering algorithms.
Slicing: Fan out controls; flatten the tree to configurable number of levels.



4. Describe different types of attributes which may come in Data Mining. Give two example of each type.

 
5. Explain different types of distance measures that can be used to compute the distances between two clusters ?


6. Consider the following data points 

12,15,16,16,19,20,21,22,22,25,25,25,25,30,33,33,35,35,35,35,36,40,45,46,52,70
     a) What is the mean of the data ? what is the median ?

       ans:The arithetic mean of the data =(sum of all the values)/count of values=788/26=30.307692307692
       median(middle value of the ordered set ,since it has even nos we take avg of middle values i.e (25+30)/2) is 27.5
        
     b) What is the mode of the data ?
       Ans:Mode(highest frequency nos) of the data=25,35(bimodal) 
        
     c) What is the midrange of the data ?
        Ans:Midrange (average of largest and smallest values in the set )=(70+12)/2=41
        
     d) Can you find (roughly ) first quartile and third quartile of the data ? 
        Ans:Q1=21 Q3=35
        
     e) Show a box plot of the data.

**7. Describe the different visualization techniques that can be used in the data mining.**

**8. What is data exploration ?**

Data exploration is the first step in data analysis and typically involves summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset. It is commonly conducted using visual analytics tools, but can also be done in more advanced statistical software, such as R.
