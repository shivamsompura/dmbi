**1. What is an outlier ? Describe methods that can be used for outlier analysis.**

An outlier is an observation point that is distant from other observations.

There are 3 types of outliers:
1.Global outlier
2.Contextual outlier.
3.Collective outlier.

Methods used for outlier analysis:

1.Supervised Methods:
. Model data normality and abnormality. 
. Domain experts examine and label a sample of the underlying data. 
. Outlier detection can then be modeled as a classification problem. 
. The task is to learn a classifier that can recognize outliers. The sample is used for training and testing.

Challenges to supervised outlier detection: 
• The two classes (i.e., normal objects versus outliers) are imbalanced. 
• That is, the population of outliers is typically much smaller than that of normal objects. 
• Therefore, methods for handling imbalanced classes may be used, such as oversampling (i.e., replicating) outliers to increase their distribution in the training set used to construct the classifier.

2.Unsupervised methods:

An unsupervised outlier detection method expects that normal objects follow a pattern far more frequently than outliers. 
Normal objects do not have to fall into one group sharing high similarity. Instead, they can form multiple groups, where each group has distinct features.

3.Semi-supervised method:

• We may encounter cases where only a small set of the normal and/or outlier objects are labeled, but most of the data are unlabeled. 
• Semi-supervised outlier detection methods were developed to tackle such scenarios.If only some labeled outliers are available, semi-supervised outlier detection is trickier. A small number of labeled outliers are unlikely to represent all the possible outliers.

4.Proximity-based methods:

Assumption: 
An object is an outlier if the nearest neighbour of the object are far away in feature space, that is, the proximity/distance of the object to its neighbors significantly deviates from the proximity of most of 
the other objects to their neighbors in the same data set.

• The effectiveness of proximity-based methods relies heavily on the proximity (or distance) measure used.
• Moreover, proximity-based methods often have difficulty in detecting a group of outliers if the outliers are close to one another. 
• There are two major types of proximity-based outlier detection, namely distance-based and density-based outlier detection.

5.Clustering-based methods:

Clustering-based methods assume that the normal data objects belong to large and dense clusters, whereas outliers belong to small or sparse clusters, or do not belong to any clusters.


2. What is an outlier ? What are the different types of outliers that can apper in the database ?
An outlier is a data object that deviates significantly from the rest of the objects, as if it were generated
by a different mechanism. For ease of presentation within this chapter, we may refer to data objects that are not outliers as “normal” or expected data. Similarly, we may refer to outliers as “abnormal” data.

In general, outliers can be classified into three categories, namely global outliers, contextual
(or conditional) outliers, and collective outliers.

Global Outliers: In a given data set, a data object is a global outlier if it deviates significantly fromthe rest of the data set. Global outliers are sometimes called point anomalies, and are the simplest type of outliers. Most outlier detection methods are aimed at finding global outliers.
To detect global outliers, a critical issue is to find an appropriate measurement of deviation with respect to the application in question. Various measurements are proposed, and, based on these, outlier detection methods are partitioned into different categories.We will come to this issue in detail later. Global outlier detection is important in many applications. Consider intrusion detection in computer networks, for example. If the communication behavior of a computer is very different from the normal patterns (e.g., a large number of packages is broadcast in a short time), this behavior may be considered as a global outlier and the corresponding computer is a suspected victim of hacking. As another example, in trading transaction auditing systems, transactions that do not follow the regulations are considered as global outliers and should be held for further examination.

Contextual Outliers: a data object is a contextual outlier if it deviates significantly with respect to a specific context of the object. Contextual outliers are also known as conditional outliers because they are conditional on the selected context. Therefore, in contextual outlier detection, the context has to be specified as part of the problem definition. Generally, in contextual outlier detection, the attributes of the data objects in question are divided into two groups: 
Contextual attributes: The contextual attributes of a data object define the object’s context. In the temperature example, the contextual attributes may be date and location.
Behavioral attributes: These define the object’s characteristics, and are used to evaluate whether the object is an outlier in the context to which it belongs. In the temperature example, the behavioral attributes may be the temperature, humidity, and pressure.
The quality of contextual outlier detection in an application depends on the meaningfulness of the contextual attributes, in addition to the measurement of the deviation of an object to the majority in the space of behavioral attributes. More often than not, the contextual attributes should be determined by domain experts, which can be regarded as part of the input background knowledge. In many applications, neither obtaining sufficient information to determine contextual attributes nor collecting high-quality contextual attribute data is easy.

Collective Outliers: Given a data set, a subset of data objects forms a collective outlier if the objects as a whole deviate significantly from the entire data set. Importantly, the individual data objects may not be outliers.

Collective outlier detection has many important applications. For example, in intrusion detection, a denial-of-service package from one computer to another is considered normal, and not an outlier at all. However, if several computers keep sending denial-of-service packages to each other, they as a whole should be considered as a collective outlier. The computers involved may be suspected of being compromised by an attack. As another example, a stock transaction between two parties is considered normal. However, a large set of transactions of the same stock among a small party in a short period are collective outliers because they may be evidence of some people manipulating the market.

Unlike global or contextual outlier detection, in collective outlier detection we have to consider not only the behavior of individual objects, but also that of groups of objects. Therefore, to detect collective outliers, we need background knowledge of the relationship among data objects such as distance or similarity measurements between objects.

In summary, a data set can have multiple types of outliers. Moreover, an object may belong to more than one type of outlier. In business, different outliers may be used in various applications or for different purposes. Global outlier detection is the simplest.

Context outlier detection requires background information to determine contextual attributes and contexts. Collective outlier detection requires background information to model the relationship among objects to find groups of outliers.
